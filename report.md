# Technical Report
## 1. Introduction
This report summarizes the processes and methodologies used in the `train.ipynb` notebook for training a machine learning model aimed at predicting household poverty levels in Costa Rica. The notebook outlines data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## 2. Data Overview
### 2.1 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis consists of various features related to household demographics, economic status, and social indicators. The target variable is a multiclass indicator of poverty status with possible values: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`.

### 2.2 Data Source
The data is sourced from <https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/>.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
### 3.1 Handling Missing Values
Missing values were identified and handled using a trained MICE kernel. For more information, see <https://pypi.org/project/miceforest/>

### 3.3 Feature Encoding
Categorical variables were encoded using [insert method, e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding].
The final feature set included [insert number] features.

## 4. Model Selection
### 4.1 Chosen Algorithms
The following algorithms were selected for training:
- Random Forest Classifier: A simple yet interpretable model.
- LightGBM Classifier: A gradient boosting framework that is efficient for large datasets.

### 4.2 Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters were tuned using [insert method, e.g., Grid Search, Random Search]. Key parameters included:
- `n_estimators`
- `learning_rate`
- `max_depth`
- `num_leaves`

## 5. Model Training
### 5.1 Cross-Validation
K-Fold cross-validation was employed to ensure the robustness of the model. The dataset was split into 5 folds, and the model was trained and validated on each fold.

### 5.2 Training Process
The training process involved:
- Fitting the model on the training data.
- Evaluating performance on the validation set using macro average f1 score.

## 6. Model Evaluation
### 6.1 Performance Metrics
The following metrics were calculated to evaluate model performance:
Accuracy: [insert value]
Precision: [insert value]
Recall: [insert value]
F1 Score: [insert value]
ROC-AUC: [insert value]

## 7. Conclusion
The training process outlined in `train.ipynb` successfully produced a model capable of predicting household poverty levels with satisfactory performance metrics. Future work may involve:
- Further hyperparameter tuning.
- Exploring additional clissifiers and combining them.
- Further feature engineering.
- Implementing model interpretability techniques.
